abstract = "As of September 2019, Monero is the most capitalized privacy-preserving cryptocurrency, and is ranked tenth among all cryptocurrencies. Monero's on-chain data privacy guarantees, i.e., how mixins are selected in each transaction, have been extensively studied. However, despite Monero's prominence, the network of peers running Monero clients has not been analyzed. Such analysis is of prime importance, since potential vulnerabilities in the peer-to-peer network may lead to attacks on the blockchain's safety (e.g., by isolating a set of nodes) and on users' privacy (e.g., tracing transactions flow in the network).",

abstract = "Recent work has demonstrated significant anonymity vulnerabilities in Bitcoin's networking stack. In particular, the current mechanism for broadcasting Bitcoin transactions allows third-party observers to link transactions to the IP addresses that originated them. This lays the groundwork for low-cost, large-scale deanonymization attacks. In this work, we present Algopp, a first-principles defense against large-scale deanonymization attacks with near-optimal information-theoretic guarantees. Dandelion++ builds upon a recent proposal called Dandelion that exhibited similar goals. However, in this paper, we highlight some simplifying assumptions made in Dandelion, and show how they can lead to serious deanonymization attacks when violated. In contrast, Dandelion++ defends against stronger adversaries that are allowed to disobey protocol. Dandelion++ is lightweight, scalable, and completely interoperable with the existing Bitcoin network. We evaluate it through experiments on Bitcoin's mainnet (i.e., the live Bitcoin network) to demonstrate its interoperability and low broadcast latency overhead.",

abstract = "Over the last decade, Bitcoin has revolutionized the global economic and technological landscape, inspiring a new generation of blockchain-based technologies. Its protocol is today among the most influential for cryptocurrencies and distributed networks. In particular, the P2P layer represents a reference point for all permissionless blockchains, which often implement its solutions in their network layer. Unfortunately, the Bitcoin network protocol lacks a strong security model, leaving it exposed to several threats. Attacks at this level can affect the reliability and trustworthiness of the consensus layer, mining the credibility of the whole system. It is therefore of utmost importance to properly understand and address the security of the Bitcoin P2P protocol. In this paper, we give a comprehensive and detailed overview of known network-level attacks in Bitcoin, as well as the countermeasures that have been implemented in the protocol. We propose a generic network adversary model, and propose an objective-based taxonomy of the attacks. Finally, we identify the core weaknesses of the protocol and study the relationship between different types of attack. We believe our contribution can help both new and experienced researchers have a broader and deeper understanding of the Bitcoin P2P network and its threats, and allow for a better modeling of its security properties.",

abstract = {Much research has investigated improving the security and performance of Tor by having Tor clients choose paths through the network in a way that depends on the client's location. However, this approach has been demonstrated to lead to serious deanonymization attacks. Moreover, we show how in some scenarios it can lead to significant performance degradation. For example, we demonstrate that using the recently-proposed Counter-RAPTOR system when guard bandwidth isn't abundant could increase median download times by 28.7\%. We propose the CLAPS system for performing client-location-aware path selection, which fixes the known security and performance issues of existing designs. We experimentally compare the security and performance of CLAPS to Counter-RAPTOR and DeNASA. CLAPS puts a strict bound on the leakage of information about the client's location, where the other systems could completely reveal it after just a few connections. It also guarantees a limit on the advantage that an adversary can obtain by strategic relay placement, which we demonstrate to be overwhelming against the other systems. Finally, due to a powerful formalization of path selection as an optimization problem, CLAPS is approaching or even exceeding the original goals of algorithms to which it is applied, while solving their known deficiencies.},

We show that sometimes the same sampling methods have been proposed again without reference to existing methods. We also show that methods that are not correct and that were widely discussed in the 1950s are being proposed again. We review the most common errors and misunderstandings about these methods.}
